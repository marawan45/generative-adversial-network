GAN Training for Handwritten Digit Generation
In this task, we are working on generating synthetic handwritten digits similar to the MNIST dataset using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN consists of two models:

Generator: This model generates synthetic images based on random noise (latent space), attempting to mimic real handwritten digits.
Discriminator: This model classifies images as either real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).
The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner:

The discriminator learns to distinguish real images from generated images.
The generator learns to produce realistic images that can fool the discriminator.
Steps Taken
Data Preprocessing:

The training data (X_train) is reshaped into a 28x28 pixel format and normalized, so the pixel values range from -1 to 1. This normalization is necessary for the generator to learn better and produce more realistic images.
Model Definitions:

Generator: A deep neural network that takes a vector of 100 random values as input and generates an image of 28x28 pixels. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers, each followed by a ReLU activation, with a final output layer using the tanh activation function.
Discriminator: A classifier that takes an image (either real or generated) and outputs a probability of whether the image is real or fake. The architecture consists of several dense layers with ReLU activations, and a final output layer using the sigmoid activation function.
Adversarial Training:

The discriminator is trained first by feeding it a batch of real images and a batch of generated images. The goal is for the discriminator to correctly classify real and fake images.
The generator is then trained by attempting to fool the discriminator. It is trained to generate images that the discriminator will classify as real, using the feedback from the discriminator.
Training Loop:

The GAN is trained over 50 epochs with a batch size of 256. In each epoch, noise is sampled from a normal distribution, and both the generator and discriminator are updated. The generator's goal is to improve the quality of its generated images, while the discriminator's goal is to become better at distinguishing between real and fake images.
Final Results:

After training, synthetic images are generated by sampling random noise. The generator produces images that resemble handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The generated images are displayed in a 5x5 grid with a title "Pictures Produced Using the GANs Model".
Visualization
The final output shows 25 generated images (5x5 grid) created by the generator after 50 epochs of training. These images are visually similar to handwritten digits, demonstrating the effectiveness of the GAN in learning the underlying distribution of real MNIST images.
